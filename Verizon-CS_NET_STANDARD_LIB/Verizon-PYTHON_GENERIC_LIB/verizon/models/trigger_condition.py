      - leave: The message is triggered when the road user leaves the
    geofence. For polygons and multi-polygons only. In case of multi-polygons
    the message is triggered when the road user leaves any of the polygons.

    geofence. For polygons and multi-polygons only. In case of multi-polygons
    the message is triggered when the road user is inside any of the polygons.
      - crossing: The message is triggered when the road user crosses the
    geofence. For lines and multi-lines only. In case of multi-lines the
