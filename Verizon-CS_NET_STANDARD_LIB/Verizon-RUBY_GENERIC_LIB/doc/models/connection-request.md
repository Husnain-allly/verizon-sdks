# Connection Request

Request for /clients/connection. It requires the device ID acquired in the registration request call; the geolocation of the device at the time of the request; and the network type (Verizon or non-Verizon). The system uses this information to determine with MQTT endpoint the device should use to connect the ETX Message Exchange.
